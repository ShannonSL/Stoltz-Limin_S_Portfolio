Portfolio

My portfolio
Setup

git clone https://github.com/ShannonSL/Stoltz-Limin_S_Portfolio

Open the folder in your command line, and install the needed dependencies:

cd Stoltz-Limin_S_Portfolio
npm install

Finally, run npm start to run the Sass compiler. The site will not show properly unless these steps are followed. In development mode, the portfolio needs to be run on a live server (MAMP/WAMP) in order for the database and json to work.
